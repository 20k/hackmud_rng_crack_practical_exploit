# hackmud_rng_crack_practical_exploit

This is the practical exploit for the hackmud rng, successfully used to crack arbitrary scripts and haunty mall

I don't play hackmud anymore, so I'm releasing this into the wild

To use this, you need a vm and a second copy of hackmud. You must have a script output "JAMES_EZ_TASK:" and then at least 3 raw doubles, and highlight all of this, then let go of the mouse

The cpp file detects this being highlighted, cracks the rng quickly, clicks on the vm window on the left screen, and types in the cracked value to look for

The way this works:

Script the first on the main client, outputs the above search task and waits for the maximum length of time (about 4400 ms). Script timeout is 5000ms

Cpp file cracks the rng, and causes the second client to write the cracked number to the database

The first client then reads the value from the database, and can use this cracked number to eg always win gambling games, or haunty mall

I will not be providing any kind of support or help for this. Hopefully someone will figure out a non z3 crack for this
